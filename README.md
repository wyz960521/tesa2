# TESA

## Overview

We introduce the TESA algorithm, which is a novel motif discovery algorithm designed for ChIP-exo data. ChIP-exo is a high-resolution DNA sequencing technique that improves the accuracy and precision of motif discovery compared to traditional ChIP-seq methods. TESA utilizes a weighted two-stage alignment procedure that takes into account positional sequencing coverage to allocate weights to sequence positions. This allows for the accurate localization of TF-DNA interaction sites and the assessment of closely located or overlapping binding occurrences. Experimental results demonstrate that TESA outperforms other motif discovery algorithms in terms of precision and the reconstruction of Position Weight Matrices (PWM) when applied to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ChIP-exo datasets. The availability of the TESA source code and benchmark datasets further enhances its potential as a valuable tool in genomic research.

Overall, we highlight the significance of TESA in improving motif discovery accuracy and precision by leveraging the higher resolution and precise localization offered by ChIP-exo data. The algorithm's weighted two-stage alignment procedure and incorporation of a "bookend" model contribute to its superior performance in identifying DNA binding patterns. The comparisons with other motif discovery algorithms and the availability of benchmark datasets further validate the effectiveness of TESA in genomic research.

## How TESA works

TESA incorporates a weighted two-stage alignment procedure and a "bookend" model to accurately identify DNA binding patterns. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

### 1. Two-stage alignment

TESA constructs a matrix with dimensions 2𝑚 × 𝑛, where 𝑚 is the number of input sequences and 𝑛 is the length of each sequence. The matrix represents both the input sequences and their reverse complementary sequences. Each position in the matrix is assigned a normalized sequencing coverage. TESA allocates weights to pairs of segments, each of length 𝑙, between different sequences based on string similarity and sequencing coverage. The statistical significance of string similarity between segments is evaluated using the binomial distribution.

### 2. Graph construction

After the two-stage alignment, TESA constructs a graph 𝐺 using the top-scoring positions from the alignment. The graph incorporates both the input sequences and their reverse complements, with each position connected by an edge.

### 3. Clique Detection

Cliques (complete subgraphs) are detected within the constructed graph using a heuristic algorithm. These cliques serve as potential motifs.

### 4. "Bookend" model

A specialized "bookend" method is deployed to optimize the length of the motifs by assessing the sequential overlaps between pairs of potential motifs.

### 5. Expansion of motif instances

In the final step, TESA expands the sets of motif instances identified in Step 4. The algorithm selects segments with elevated motif match scores and uses these instances to construct the motif PWM.

## Sequence set

The sequence set refers to the collection of DNA sequences that are used as input data for motif discovery algorithms. The sequence set is specifically derived from ChIP-exo data. The ChIP-exo data includes the reference genome file in `FASTA` format, a narrow peak file in BED format, and one or multiple sequencing coverage files in `bigWig` format. These files are processed and transformed into the `TESA` format, which combines the narrow peaks represented in `FASTA` format with normalized sequencing coverages. This sequence set is then used as input for the TESA algorithm to identify DNA binding motifs.

## Installation

Enter the folder `tesa` and type `make` then the compiled codes are within the same directory as the source.

## Inputs and outputs

The major program in the provided package is `tesa`. It is capable of parsing standard `FASTA` format files, allowing sequences with different lengths. Example files are provided for reference.

To access help and view all available options.

```console
$ ./tesa -h (./tesa)
```

Take a look at `example` (`FASTA` file) first. Then, you can run `tesa` with a specific length parameter `l`, where the program will handle segments of that length or greater during the two-stage alignment process to identify potential motifs. For example, you can run the following command to specify segments with length exactly 14.

```console
$ ./tesa -i example -l 14
```
For each input file with a specific length parameter `l`, the program will generate an output file, namely, `'.closures'` file. This file contains all the closures, which represent the instances of identified motifs.

Additionally, you can run `tesa` recognizing the correct length in the scope `[L,U]` by our program automatically.

```console
$ ./tesa -i example -L 14 -U 16
```

`L` and `U` are lower and upper length of segments during two-stage alignment separately. This is useful when the accurate length is not known in advance. We sort the top `n` closures under each specific length in the increasing order of their *P*-values and save the top `o` closures in the `'.closures'` file. Especially, when the input value of `L` equals to `U`, it is equivalent to finding motifs in a specific length. For example, `'./tesa -i example -L 14 -U 14'` is equivalent to `'./tesa -i example -l 14'`.

## Running TESA using an input file with sequencing coverage

You can run TESA with another option using sequencing coverage according to the following instructions:
 
1. Make sure both ```BEDTools``` and ```BigWigMerge``` are ready. 
   
   `BEDTools`: https://BEDTools.readthedocs.io/en/latest
   
   `BigWigMerge`: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/ucsc-bigwigmerge

2. A peak file with `BED` format (for instance, `[PREFIX].bed`), several `bigWig` files for example named `[PREFIX]_Forward.bw` and `[PREFIX]_Reverse.bw` respectively and a reference file with `FASTA` format with its index file of `FASTA.FAI` format are required. For instance, there is a toy run with `test.bed`, `test_Forward.bw`, `test_Reverse.bw`, `sequence.fa` and `sequence.fa.fai` as input. Additionally, you can generate reference using `SAMTools`. 

   `SAMTools`: https://github.com/samtools/samtools

3. Run preprocessing script and generate output file `*.tesa`.

```console
$ chmod +x preprocess.sh
$ ./preprocess.sh [PEAK_PREFIX] [REFERENCE_FILE] [REFERENCE_INDEX_FILE] [OUTPUT_PREFIX]
```
For instance:
```console
$ ./preprocess.sh TEST sequence.fa sequence.fa.fai TEST_out
```   
4. Run TESA beyond new input with sequencing coverage.
```console
$ ./tesa [OUTPUT_PREFIX].tesa
```
